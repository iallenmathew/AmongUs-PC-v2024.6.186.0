# About
AmongUs is a paid game and needs to be bought either from Steam or Microsoft Store so this repo will basically allow you to play it for free.
We want to clarify that we do not support or endorse hacking games. As a community, we believe in respecting the hard work and creativity of game developers. 
Purchasing games not only helps support their passion but also allows them to continue creating amazing content.

If you're unable to purchase a game due to financial constraints, then you can enjoy it from here :)
Let's keep supporting creators and preserving the integrity of their work!

# How To Run a Game:
1. Turn OFF your Antivirus and/or Windows Defender before you extract the game. ( If the system throws no alerts, then its okay if not disabled!)
   
2. Extract the game in the drive where you want to keep it.
   
3. All the programs in the _CommonRedist folder must be installed to run a game. ( I would say before installing once check running the game, if game shows error then go up with this step)
   
4. Navigate to the '.exe' file of the game and Run it

# Before making an Issue
No specific format is required but please make sure that I can actually tell what you're trying to say

If you're making an issue about the program no longer working or being outdated, check first if there is already a similar issue open. If not, feel free to open one titled "Not Working on the Latest Version" or something similar.

If you have problems with your antivirus, contact whoever made the antivirus, not me. Unless you're using Windows Defender, the only advice I'll be able to give is to disable your antivirus entirely, but this often may not be the best course of action if you want to, like, actually use your antivirus. If you're worried that this program actually is a virus, you can check out the source code and compile the program yourself.

If you want to use parts of my code from this repository for your own projects, you have full permission to do so as long as you give credit.

If I don't respond to an issue for more than a week, I probably forgot it existed (unless I stated somewhere that I would not be fixing the issue for a while). Feel free to reply to the issue and remind me.

# Contributing
I doubt that anyone will actually make a pull request but if you decide to do that just make it, there's no format or anything
